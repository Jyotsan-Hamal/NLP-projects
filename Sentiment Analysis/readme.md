# NLP Sentiment Analysis Project

## Introduction

Hello fellow developers! ðŸ‘‹ I am an IT student deeply passionate about NLP, particularly sentiment analysis. This project represents my journey into the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing.

## Project Overview

### Sentiment Analysis

#### Project Description

In this project, I developed a sentiment analysis model from scratch, aiming to understand and classify the sentiment expressed in given text data. The model was built without relying on pre-trained models from libraries such as Hugging Face Transformers, showcasing a hands-on approach to NLP.

#### Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn,Pytorch,pickle
- **Model:** Custom sentiment analysis model

#### Achievements

- Conducted thorough text data preprocessing for effective model training.
- Implemented a sentiment analysis model without leveraging pre-trained models.
- Fine-tuned the model for improved accuracy on specific sentiment analysis tasks.

## Project Structure

The project repository is organized as follows:

- **`train.csv`**: Contains the raw and processed data used in the project.
- **`sentiment.pth`**: Stores the trained sentiment analysis model.
- **`Sentiment Analysis`**: Jupyter notebooks documenting the data exploration, model development, and evaluation processes.
