YODA,"The very Republic is threatened, if involved the Sith are."
YODA,"Hard to see, the dark side is. Discover who this assassin is, we must."
YODA,"With this Naboo queen you must stay, Qui-Gon. Protect her."
YODA,May the Force be with you.
YODA,(Cont'd) Master Qui-Gon more to say have you?
YODA,"A vergence, you say?"
YODA,But you do! Rrevealed your opinion is.
YODA,"Trained as a Jedi, you request for him?"
YODA,Tested he will be.
YODA,"Good, good, young one. How feel you?"
YODA,Afraid are you?
YODA,"See through you, we can."
YODA,Afraid to lose her..I think.
YODA,Eveything. Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to anger... anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering.
YODA,"A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. I sense much fear in you."
YODA,"Then continue, we will."
YODA,"...Correct you were, Qui-Gon."
YODA,"Clouded, this boy's future is. Masked by his youth."
YODA,"An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible, to take on a second."
YODA,"Ready so early, are you? What know you of ready?"
YODA,"Our own council we will keep on who is ready. More to learn, he has..."
YODA,And draw out the Queen's attacker.
YODA,Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later.
YODA,"Train him not. Take him with you, but train him not!"
YODA,May the Force be with you.
YODA,"Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight the Coucil does. But agree on you taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I do not."
YODA,"The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless, grave danger I fear in his training."
YODA,"Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree, the council does. Your apprentice, young Skywalker will be."
YODA,Always two there are....no more...no less. A master and an apprentice.
YODA, Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . .
YODA," Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?"
YODA, . . . close to you?
YODA," Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side."
YODA," Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is."
YODA, Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
YODA," Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine."
YODA," Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep."
YODA," Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait."
YODA," Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have."
YODA," Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers."
YODA, A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.
YODA," I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you."
YODA," Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed."
YODA," A Master is needed, with more experience."
YODA," Obi-Wan, my choice is."
YODA, I agree.
YODA," Then now the time is, Commander."
YODA, To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take.
YODA," Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me."
YODA," (continuing) Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . ."
YODA," Good-bye. Chewbacca and Tarfful, miss you I will. Good friends you are. For your help, much gratitude and respect, I have."
YODA," Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you. it is."
YODA," With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did."
YODA," Heard from no one, have we."
YODA," Received a coded retreat message, we have."
YODA," Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?"
YODA, I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves ... a little more knowledge might light our way.
YODA," If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be."
YODA," Dismantle the coded signal quickly. That group back there, soon discovered will be."
YODA," Killed not by clones, this Padawan. By a lightsaber, he was."
YODA," Good . . . For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will take. To change it back, longer still. Hurry."
YODA," If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find."
YODA," Destroy the Sith, we must."
YODA," To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not."
YODA," Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is . . . Consumed by Darth Vader."
YODA," To question, no time there is."
YODA," Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will. Visit the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you."
YODA," I hear a new apprentice, you have. Emperor, or should I call you Darth Sidious."
YODA, Surprised?
YODA," Not if anything I have to say about it, Lord Sidious."
YODA," (continuing) At an end your rule is and not short enough it was, I must say."
YODA," (continuing) If so powerful you are, why leave??"
YODA," Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force."
YODA," Destroy you I will, just as Master Kenobi, your apprentice will destroy."
YODA, Hurry. Careful timing we will need.
YODA," Into exile I must go. Failed, I have."
YODA," Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have. Still much to learn, there is ..."
YODA, Eternal consciousness.
YODA," . . . to become one with the Force, and influence still have . . . A power greater than all, it is."
YODA," A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn. Your apprentice I gratefully become."
YODA," Save them, we must. They are our last hope."
YODA," Pregnant, she must still appear. Hidden, safe, the children must be kept."
YODA," Split up, they should be."
YODA," To Tatooine. To his family, send him."
YODA," Strong the Force runs, in the Skywalker line. Hope, we can . . . Done, it is. Until the time is right, disappear we will."
YODA," (continuing) Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you."
YODA, An old friend has learned the path to immortality.
YODA," One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me . . . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn."
YODA," The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to commune with him. I will teach you."
YODA," How to join the Force, he will train you. Your consciousness you will retain, when one with the Force. Even your physical self, perhaps."
YODA,Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?
YODA,"Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have."
YODA,Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me 
YODA,No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
YODA,Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.
YODA,Your father he is.
YODA,"Told you, did he?"
YODA,"Unexpected this is, and unfortunate..."
YODA,"Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, "
YODA,"Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, "
