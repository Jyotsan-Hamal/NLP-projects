# NLP Projects Repository

Welcome to my NLP Projects Repository! Here, I document my journey in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and share the progress of various projects. Feel free to explore the different projects listed below:

## 1. Nepali Sentiment Analysis [Incomplete]

This project focuses on sentiment analysis for the Nepali language. Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral. The project is currently in progress, and further updates will be added as development continues.

## 2. English Sentiment Analysis [Complete]

This project successfully implements sentiment analysis for the English language. The sentiment analysis model is complete and functional. You can explore the code and findings related to sentiment analysis in English text. Feel free to check out the project details and results.

## 3. Yoda Chatbot [Still needs tuning, looking for data]

The Yoda Chatbot project aims to create a chatbot with a Yoda-like personality. However, the project is still in the early stages and requires further tuning. I am actively looking for additional data to enhance the chatbot's performance. Updates will be provided as the project progresses.

## 4. Rasa-based Chatbot [In progress]

This project involves the development of a chatbot using the Rasa framework. Rasa is an open-source conversational AI platform, and this project is currently in progress. Stay tuned for updates on the implementation and performance of the Rasa-based chatbot.

Feel free to explore the individual project folders for more details, including code, datasets used, and any relevant documentation. If you have any suggestions, questions, or would like to contribute, feel free to reach out.

I welcome contributions from the community! If you are interested in working on the Rasa-based Chatbot project or have ideas for improvement, I would be glad to collaborate. Feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. I will gladly review and merge well-documented and well-tested contributions to the main branch.
